        Twelve-figure estate plan, that was the escape plan
        But hate investigatin', that sh- was a waste, man
        But wait, I stopped the facin' 'cause sh- just start erasin'
        But wait, it opened gates and this sh- just start paradin', olé (let's go)
        We out the basement, on one floor where it's vacant
        She feelin' anxious to be out where it's dangerous, okay (it's lit)
        Love how the chains hit, especially how I bang it, okay
        Jamaican-Spanglish, she mixed up in her language, hey bae (yeah)

        That WAP need draining, just havе it if you singing, okay (whoa)
        Fuck that Birkin, she just need some encouragеment (uh)
        Fix that attitude, she think she need a surgeon, okay
        And show some gratitude, I put you in that altitude, okay
        It's stuck like magnets do, I put you in that magnitude, oh, hey (yeah)
        I embrace the-, I'm not tryna embarrass you (straight up, ah)
        Okay, I got a lavish crew, me and Chase, the rocker, dated you
        Me and Bizzy trap, I'm not a rapper, a lot I do, a lot at you (woo, woo)
        A film director, Helter Skelter, off the seltzer like it's juice (let's go, yeah)
